# Fun with LinuxBrew and Docker

This is a small test environment for LinuxBrew with Docker. Currently there is a Dockerfile that sets up a basic Linux environment (with gcc, ruby, etc). The default command is to run the install_linuxbrew.sh script. The status of the gcc test is checked at the end.
